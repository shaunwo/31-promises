# 31.2 JavaScript Promises

## Part 1: Number Facts
1. Make a request to the Numbers API ([http://numbersapi.com/](http://numbersapi.com/)) to get a
fact about your favorite number.

> The result of this call is in the console.

2. Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request. Make that request and when
you get the data back, put all of the number facts on the page.

> The result of this call are on the html page: [https://shaunwo.github.io/31-promises/nums](https://shaunwo.github.io/31-promises/nums)

## Part 2: Deck of Cards
1. Make a request to the Deck of Cards API ([http://deckofcardsapi.com/](http://deckofcardsapi.com/)) to request a single card
from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, console.log the value and the suit (e.g. “5 of
spades”, “queen of diamonds”).

> The result of this call is in the console.

2. Make a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once
you have the card, make a request to the same API to get one more card from the same deck.
Once you have both cards, console.log the values and suits of both cards.

> The result of this call is in the console.

3. Build an HTML page that lets you draw cards from a deck. When the page loads, go to the Deck of
Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card. Every
time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck.

> The result of this call are on the html page: [https://shaunwo.github.io/31-promises/cards](https://shaunwo.github.io/31-promises/cards)
